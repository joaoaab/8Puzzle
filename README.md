# 8Puzzle Solver

The Project target is to create a solver for the 8Puzzle game using concepts and algorithms learned at Intelligent Systems class

## Getting Started

Using Visual Studio, open the 8Puzzle.sln project and then build it (no external libs required)

## What it does
Currently it applies three complete algorithm to solve the puzzle
* [A* or A Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
* [BFS - Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
* [Best First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search)


## How it is implemented
the project has a class that implements all the rules of the game(puzzle) and one to solve it(solver), also it has one class to implement a tree/graph type of structure(tree) to use in the algorithms

### Prerequisites
Visual Studio Installed
